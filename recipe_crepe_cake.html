<ul>
  <li>Ingredients</li>
    <ol>
      <li>1/2 cup warm water</li>
      <li>1 cup milk</li>
      <li>4 large eggs</li>
      <li>4 tablespoons unsalted butter, melted, plus more to saute</li>
      <li>1 cup all-purpose flour</li>
      <li>2 tablespoons granulated sugar</li>
      <li>pinch of salt</li>
      <li>1 cup unsalted butter,softened at room temperature </li>
      <li>12 oz sweetened condensed milk (from a 14 oz can -- filled by weight)
      <li>8oz cream cheese,softened at room tmperature</li>
      <li>2 teaspoons vanilla extract</li>
    </ol>
  <li> Instructions </li>
    <ol>
      <li>In the bowl of a blender, add the crepe ingredients in the order they are listed: 1/2 cup warm water, 1 cup milk, 4 large eggs, 4 Tbsp melted butter, 1 cup all-purpose flour, 2 Tbsp sugar and a pinch of salt. Blend until well combined, scraping down the sides with a spatula if needed then set aside.</li>
      <li>Heat a medium (9-inch) non-stick pan over medium heat. Add a tiny dot of butter and spread it around with a spatula to lightly coat. Once the butter is hot, add about 3 Tbsp of batter, or enough to lightly coat the bottom of the pan, swirling the skillet as you add the batter to evenly coat the bottom of the pan. Sauté about 30 seconds per side or until lightly golden then flip using a thin edged spatula and sauté another 30 seconds or until the second side is golden. Remove to a clean surface such as a cutting board and allow the layers to cool to room temperature before stacking them.</li>
      <li>In the bowl of a stand mixer fitted with whisk attachment, beat butter and condensed milk with whisk attachment on high speed 7 minutes. It should look whipped and lightened in color.</li>
      <li>Add 8 oz of softened cream cheese 1 Tbsp at a time while mixing on medium high speed. Continue beating for 3 minutes or until no longer lumpy. Add 2 tsp vanilla and whisk until well incorporated and smooth. Some tiny lumps are ok and will not be noticeable once the cake is ready to enjoy.</li>
      <li>Place the first crepe layer onto your serving platter and spread about 3 Tbsp or 1 ice cream scoop of frosting between each crepe layer for a total of 15 crepes and 15 layers of cream.</li>
      <li>Refrigerate the cake for at least 6 hours or until frosting has firmed up (can be made 2 days ahead) – it will be much easier to slice after refrigeration and won’t slide apart. To serve, dust with powdered sugar and top with fresh berries if desired.</li>
